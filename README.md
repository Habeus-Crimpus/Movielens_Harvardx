# Movielens_Harvardx

This is my movie recommendation project for Harvard University's Professional Certificate in Data Science. 

Language Used: R

Machine Learning Techniques Used: Linear regression, regularization, Recosystem matrix factorization.

Three files are currently included in this repository (Shiny document coming at a later date):

1. Movielens_10M_PDF is a PDF copy of the knitted R Markdown report.
2. MovieLens_10M is the R Markdown file from which the PDF is knitted. 
3. movielens_hx_c9 is the raw code file. For the most up to date version of the code used, I recommend seeing the Rmd file instead.

Warning: It is not recommended that the Rmd be knit unless you are operating with a minimum of 32GB of RAM. While the file should knit properly regardless of RAM (tested with as little as 8GB), the time to complete the knit is in excess of 3 hours for 8GB computers.
